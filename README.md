## Working
Medibot's operation is backed by a Django backend that connects it to the internet, enabling communication with the web-based interface. The user interface, hosted online, lets doctors interact with Medibot, manage consultations, and dispense medication remotely.

Medibot's physical actions are executed via a NodeMCU microcontroller within the robot. This device receives instructions from the website and controls Medibot's mechanical components. The robot's design accommodates a pill dispensing system. As the NodeMCU gets medication details, it activates servo motors that open passages for precise pill dispensing.




## Benefits and Impact
Medibot offers several benefits:

1. **Improved Medication Adherence:** Automating pill dispensing reduces errors and improves adherence to treatment plans.
2. **Time Efficiency for Professionals:** With pill dispensing automated, healthcare providers can focus on critical tasks.
3. **Enhanced Patient-Doctor Interaction:** Video calls enable remote consultations, saving time and costs.
4. **Reduced Healthcare Costs:** Automation minimizes errors and optimizes workflow, cutting costs.



## Objective:
Enhanced Patient Care: Medical robots with IoT and AI intelligence aim to deliver personalized medical care through data analysis, leading to improved treatment plans and outcomes.

Innovative Diagnostics: These robots seek to enhance diagnostic accuracy by leveraging AI algorithms to interpret medical data, including images and patient histories.

Remote Monitoring and Intervention:The robots aspire to enable remote patient monitoring, facilitating timely interventions and extending healthcare services to underserved or remote areas.

Revolutionizing Medical Practices: By revolutionizing surgical precision, drug discovery, and rehabilitation therapies, these robots aim to reshape healthcare practices for more efficient, accurate, and patient-centric services.
